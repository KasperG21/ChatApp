# GuChat
_A simple chatapp, written in C#._

This client-side application is part of my Chatapp in C# project.
It is a learning project, so don't expect too much of it.

### GOALS:
- Provide a working chatapp that can send and receive messages to a server
- Provide a suitable TUI for that chatapp
- Provide a chatroom implementation with the possibility to join multiple different servers, all protected with a password
- Provide encryption to the messages to keep them safe
